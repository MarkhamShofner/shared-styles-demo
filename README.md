# Shared Style Demo

**As a user (developer) I can can follow example web page and docs to create my own shared-style page**

### Concept
The idea is to create an explanation mechanism that clarifies the shared-style component of hub-ready apps. An example app and attached docs will allow internal Esri developers (and eventually Citizens) to create hub-ready applications, whether they are starting from scratch or looking to make an existing app hub-ready.

##### Clarification on Hub-Ready apps
See https://github.com/ArcGIS/Hub and https://github.com/ArcGIS/Hub/blob/master/specification.md.
For now, this story aims to facilitate the incorporation of the "shared style" portion of hub-ready apps. Other major components of hub-ready apps (that can be addressed down the line in other stories) include:
- Schema matching
- Link apps to data
- Category Ontology
- Item Listing
- Structured License
- etc...
